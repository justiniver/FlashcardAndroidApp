# Flashcard Learning Android App
This project is a follow-up application to some of my previous flashcard projects. It enhances the functionality by allowing users to choose and sift through flashcards more effectively through an intuitive interface.

###### New features, such as a text field for answers and the use of Levenshtein distance to determine the correctness of a user's answer, have been added.
###### A video showing these changes will be made in the future.
